			A <a href="http://www.hpcloud.com" target="_blank">public cloud service such as HP Cloud Computing</a> is the most reliable environment to host VMs in. Eventually, this web application may be able to deploy your provisioned VM onto an HP Cloud instance straight from this GUI interface. The VMs could also be timed to be <a href="http://woki/display/IntDev/Short-lived+VMs%2C+built+on+demand" title="Short-lived VMs, built on demand" target="_blank">short-lived</a>, reducing resource wastage due to idle VMs while providing fast and flexible dev & test environments.<br>

			In a recent survey of VM usage...
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b><span class="teal">75% were unhappy</span></b> with performance</li>
			<li><b><span class="teal">79%</span></b> of VMs run <b>24/7</b></li>
			<li><b><span class="teal">0.8% utilisation</span></b> of VMs (usage/uptime)</li>
			<li><b><span class="teal">1-5 day wait time</span></b> for a new VM</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This may be a result of VMs not being able to be spun up by developers and testers due to the lack of available APIs, and also the difficulty of provisioning the VMs with Orion Health products and its dependencies once a VM is acquired.<br><br>

		<h3 class="docs">Why VMs, and why on a public cloud?</h3>

		<p>
			VMs are ideal for software quality assurance, as they can provide a clean and consistent test environment. Smart utilisation of VMs can maximise efficiency and productivity.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li><b><span class="orange">Isolation</span></b><br>
				VMs can isolate applications from one another, and from programmes on your daily OS to <b>minimise interference</b> with tests.</li><br>
			<li><b><span class="orange">Consolidation</span></b><br>
				They are much <b>quicker to boot</b> and <b>cheaper to maintain</b> than physical machines. <b>Multiple VMs</b> can be run on one physical machine.</li><br>
			<li><b><span class="orange">Ease of testing</span></b><br>
				VMs are <b>easily configurable</b> to fit your needs. Also, many virtualisation packages come with features designed for testing like <b>snap shots</b>.</li><br>
			<li><b><span class="orange">Mobility</span></b><br>
				Images can be moved around and copied across physical machines as <b>single files</b>, making them <b>flexible</b> and <b>easy to deploy</b>.</li>

			By outsourcing the hosting of our VMs to a public cloud such as HP Cloud (already used by the Orion Continuous Delivery team for testing and development of tooling), this allows us as developers to focus on our own code, without having to worry about potential problems with the server. It saves us from using up our own resources, and is also more consistent than our current local OpenStack server, <a href="http://ocd-devstack" target="_blank">DevStack</a>, which tends to fail when overloaded.
		</p>

		<h3 class="docs">HP Cloud & OpenStack API</h3>

		<p>
			HP Cloud is based on <a href="http://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/profile/hp">OpenStack technology</a>. In order for Give-Me-A-Deploy to be able to "talk" to the HP Cloud Compute service, the proposed extension on this current app would require some server-side script that implements some OpenStack API. There are several options for this:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>OpenStack's comment-line client, Nova, written in Python.</li>
			<li>OpenStack's Ruby API binding, Ruby Fog.</li>
			<li>HP Cloud's own extensions to the Ruby Fog binding.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			These options will have to be further investigated with respect to the capabilities of the server-side language chosen.

		<h3 class="docs">The advantage of VMs being short-lived</h3>

		VMs need not take up resources and remain idleMaking these on-demand VMs short-lived, meaning that they automatically expire after 48 hours, would eliminate idle VMs which waste resources, while continuing to provide consistent, fast and flexible environments for developers and testers.
