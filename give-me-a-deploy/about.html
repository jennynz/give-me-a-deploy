		<p>
			Before being able to spin up VMs from a GUI web application, Give-Me-A-Deploy (then called <a href="C:/Users/jennysa/Documents/give-me-a-vagrant/index.html">Give-Me-A-Vagrant</a>) output deployable source code which could be downloaded and run with a few commands for a fully configured local VM. The process however was still slow and manual, and as they required manual termination, it did not solve the core problem of idle VMs.<br><br>

			Give-Me-A-Deploy is a GUI configurator which allows you to launch a customised VM in an environment of your choice. The VMs are set to be <a href="http://woki/display/IntDev/Short-lived+VMs%2C+built+on+demand" title="Short-lived VMs, built on demand" target="_blank">short-lived</a>. They automatically expire after 48 hours (unless specified), cutting down on resource wastage due to idle VMs and making the deployment process as quick and hassle-free as possible.<br><br>
