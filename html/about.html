		<p>
			Give-Me-A-Deploy web-based GUI application that generates scripts which automatically create, configure and provision Virtual Machines (a.k.a. VMs). It uses the <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> command line VM manager with its built-in <a href="http://blogs/richardpa/2014/01/14/introducing-puppet/" target="_blank">Puppet automation tool</a> to install and configure Orion Health products using <a href="http://stash/projects/PUPPET/repos/puppet-ohp/browse" target="_blank">the same OHP Puppet modules used in production</a>. It aims to make VMs as quick and easy as possible for users at Orion Health, as they provide ideal, consistent environments for development and testing.<br><br>

			For more information, please have a read of these <a href="http://slid.es/jennysahng/give-me-a-vagrant">presentation slides</a> and the <a href="lightningtalk.html">lightning talk</a> from the intern projects demo.

		<h2 class="about">Next up: <span class="teal">Short-lived VMs</span>, <span class="teal">built on-demand</span></h2>

		<p>
			While the current Give-Me-A-Deploy is ideal for spinning up VMs locally using custom generated source code, it would be even better to have provisioned VMs spun up in a public server such as HP Cloud, straight from our GUI interface. A third party server would allow developers and testers to focus on their applications and code without worrying about potential server issues.<br><br>

			By making these on-demand VMs also <a href="http://woki/display/IntDev/Short-lived+VMs%2C+built+on+demand" title="Short-lived VMs, built on demand" target="_blank">short-lived</a> (automatically expiring after 48 hours), we would also eliminate the problem of idle VMs wasting server resources while continuing to provide an efficient solution to the demand for fast and flexible development environments.<br>
			<span class="orange"><b>It's less time setting up your environments, and more time working in them.</b></span><br><br>
