# Automated deployment of virtual machines for testing

## Project Deliverables

The aim of this project is to improve reliability of software testing in a deployed environment and forms a part of the continuous integration plan of reducing time to release for our * software products. Using our internal systems and tools, the intern will work alongside the Product Development team to deliver the project. This will involve:

* Researching process and workflow needs
* Technical design and build-out of the integration
* Testing and bug-fixing
* Documentation of processes

## Intern information

Jenny Sahng - Bachelor of Arts / Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Conjoint, Specialisation in Biomedical Engineering
James Han - Bachelor of Engineering (Hons)/ Bachelor of Commerce

## Project Overview

*What increased capability, product, process or market knowledge do you expect to attain as a result of this project?*
The current process of deploying Orion Health products for testing can be an arduous task. By adopting automation practices the deployment process can be reduced from days to hours. This frees up both time and server resourcing resulting in reduced cost and greater productivity.

*Why is this of benefit to the company and what is its relevance to the main activities of the company or business unit? What steps are in place to ensure the intern is mentored through their internship?*
Orion Health promotes a strong innovative culture within the company and we are constantly looking for ways to enhance our product offerings to improve patient health. The Development team are responsible for the technical execution of the software.
By having this application, the teams will benefit from:
* Better software reliability: because they will not have to deal with uncertain software environments running on an existing virtual machine
* Greater productivity: this application enables the teams to focus time and effort on actual development and not unnecessary error fixing

*Through our graduate and internship programs in the past, we have experience with leading and mentoring intern and successfully demonstrating project outcomes. The chosen intern will have access to a network of key individuals across the business. We will support the intern with a broad scope including:*
* Giving them a buddy they can go to with any questions
* Integration into the product development team
* Formal and informal 1:1 catchups with senior business leaders
* Technical and commercial team meetings to facilitate knowledge transfer

*As a result of this project, what revenues, profits or cost savings do you expect in dollars per annum?*
This project will help us realise cost savings in terms of time saved for all development teams. Software testing within a development environment can be a challenging task and can potentially take a lot of time fixing the environment and divert focus away from building reliable software. Exact dollar amounts are hard to quantify but we know from experience that this is an important requirement to help speed up the deployment of our systems. 

*How will these benefits be realised? What market channels will be used to create the extra revenues or how will profits or cost savings be realised?*
We will realise the benefits of this project through educating our development teams to use this application effectively. Cost savings will be achieved by saving on development time spent.
